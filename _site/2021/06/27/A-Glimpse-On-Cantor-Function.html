<meta name="description" content="On Cantor’s Function Presentation Competition, June 2021 Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira Introduction Cantor set (or, Cantor ternary set) is an intriguing and unusual subset of \(\mathbb{R}\), which is constructed by successively removing &quot;middle thirds&quot; from the interval \([0,1]\). We denote the Cantor set by : \(\Delta\). Set theory tells us that \(\Delta\) is uncountable. More precisely, The cardinality of Cantor’s set is the continuum. That is, Cantor’s set has the same cardinality as the interval \([0, 1]\) and that of the whole \(\mathbb{R}\). Measure theory tells us that \(\Delta\) is &quot;small&quot;, i.e., it has measure \(0\). Topology tells us that \(\Delta\) is a perfect set and is totally disconnected. And also, Geometry tells us that \(\Delta\) is a Fractal (self-similar). From the construction of \(\Delta\), we also have \(x \in \Delta\), if and only if \(x\) can be written as \(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{3^n}\), where each \(a_n \in \{0,2\}\). With all these properties in mind, we define a correspondence between \(\Delta\) and \([0,1]\) in the following section. The Cantor Function We define the Cantor function \(f: \Delta \to [0,1]\) by \[f\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2b_n}{3^n}\right)= \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{2^n} \qquad (b_n = 0, 1).\]i.e. \[f(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots (\text{base } 3))=0.\frac{a_1}{2}\frac{a_2}{2}\frac{a_3}{2}\cdots (\text{base 2}) \qquad (a_n = 0, 2).\] From the definition of the Cantor function, we can see that \(f\) is increasing. i.e., if \(x,y \in \Delta\) with \(x&lt;y\), then \(f(x)\leq f(y)\). Now, if \(x \in \Delta\) has two ternary expansions, i.e., \(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1= 0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n0222\ldots\), then \[\begin{aligned} f(x)&amp;=f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1 (\text{base } 3)) \\ &amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n0222\ldots(\text{base } 3)) \\ &amp;= 0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n0111\ldots (\text{base } 2) \qquad(b_n = 0, 1) \\ &amp;= 0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n1 (\text{base } 2) \\ &amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n2 (\text{base } 3)) \end{aligned}\] Now, if \(x, y \in \Delta\) are consecutive endpoints of the form \(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1\) and \(y=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n2\) in base \(3\), then from the previous result, we have \(f(x)=f(y)\). Hence we have the following result: Let \(f:\Delta \to [0,1]\) be the Cantor function (defined above) and let \(x,y \in \Delta\) with \(x&lt;y\). Then \(f(x) \leq f(y)\). Equality holds if and only if \(x\) and \(y\) are consecutive endpoints. Now, as the Cantor function is surjective, we have \(|\Delta| \geq |[0,1]|\), and by construction of Cantor set, \(|\Delta| \leq |[0,1]|\). Hence, from Schoeder-Bernstein theorem, \(|\Delta|=|[0,1]|\). So, \(\Delta\) is uncountable and has cardinality equal to that of continuum. With the above properties of the cantor function defined on \(\Delta\), we extend this function on the interval \([0,1]\) in the following section. Extended Cantor Function With the observation in Proposition 0.1, we take \(f\) to be an appropriate constant on each of the open intervals that make up \([0,1]\backslash \Delta\). For example, \(f(x)=f(1/3)=1/2\) for each \(x\) in the interval \((1/3,2/3)\), and \(f(x)=f(1/9)=1/4\) for each \(x \in (1/9,2/9)\). We define \[f(x)= \sup\{f(y):y\in \Delta, y \leq x\} \qquad \forall~ x \in [0,1]\backslash \Delta\] Now, since the Cantor function is increasing and the extended function is constant on every open interval, \(f\) is increasing on \([0,1]\). Also from the definition of Cantor function, we have \(f\) is a surjection, which is easy to verify. Now we prove the continuity of \(f\) in \([0,1]\). To prove the desired result we use the following theorem. If \(f:(a,b) \to \mathbb{R}\) is monotone, then \(f\) has atmost countably many points of discontinuity in \((a,b)\) and all of which are jump discontinuities. If \(f: [a,b] \to [c,d]\) is both monotone and onto, then \(f\) is continuous. Corollary :The Cantor function \(f:[0,1]\to [0,1]\) is continuous. Hence, we have the required result that, the function \(f\) is increasing and continuous. Again \(f&#39;=0\) at almost every point in \([0,1]\), i.e. \(f&#39;=0\) on \([0,1]\backslash \Delta\), a set of measure \(1\). So, \(f\) is also called singular function. We have therefore shown that \(f\) is continuous, monotonic, non-constant, and singular. We now investigate the differentiability of \(f\) at the points of \(\Delta\). At a left hand endpoint of a complementary interval, the right-hand derivative exists and is equal to \(0\). And similarly, a left-hand derivative at a right hand end point of is equal to \(0\). Now, let \(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n200\ldots\) (base \(3\)), be a right hand end point. Let, \(m&gt;n\) and \(h \in (3^{-m-1},3^{-m})\), hence, \[\frac{3^{m}}{2^{m+1}} \leq \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\]Now, \(h\to 0 \implies m \to \infty\), therefore, \[\lim\limits_{m \to \infty}\frac{3^m}{2^{m+1}} \leq \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \lim\limits_{m \to \infty} \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\] Hence, at a right hand end point and a left hand end point \(x\), we have right hand derivative \(f&#39;_+(x)=+\infty\) and left hand derivative \(f&#39;_-(x)=0\). Cantor Type Functions One of the major breakthroughs in the history of mathematics, i.e., one of the first set-theoretical result of Cantor was his discovery of the existence of a bijection between \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A previously known result was a bijection between \(\mathbb{N}\) and \(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\). The standard partition \((\{0, 2, 4, \ldots\}, \{1, 3, 5, \ldots\})\) of \(\mathbb{N}\) into two infinite sets shows the existence of a bijection between \(\mathbb{N}\) and \((\mathbb{N} \times \{0\}) \cup (\mathbb{N} \times \{1\})\). By starting with the latter bijection, it is not hard to establish a one-to-one correspondence between \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (respectively, between the unit segment \([0, 1]\) and the unit square \([0,1]^2\)). Keeping these in mind we define the following. Definition :A map \(f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2\) (respectively from \([0,1]\) into \([0,1]^2\)) is a Cantor type function if \(f\) is a bijection. With the previous discussion, it is now clear that Cantor type function exists. Now we have the following theorems. Theorem : If \(f\) is a cantor type function, then it is not continuous. Proof If possible, let \(f\) is continuous. Then we wrte, \[\mathbb{R}^2 = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f([-n,n])\]where \(f([-n,n])\) is compact (closed) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), \(\forall~ n \in \mathbb{N}\). Now, from Baire Category Theorem, at least one of these sets have non-empty interior. Let \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) be such that \((f([-k,k]))^{\circ} \neq \phi.\) So, we have the bijective continuous mapping \[f|_{[-k,k]}:[-k,k]\to f([-k,k])\]which is a homeomorphism between \([-k,k]\) to \(f([-k,k])\). So, the function \(f^{-1}\) defined by \[f^{-1}|_{f([-k,k])}:f([-k,k])\to [-k,k]\]is also a homeomorphism. Now, let \(L \subset f([-k,k])\) such that \(L\) is isometric to \[\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2=r, r&gt;0\}\](The existence of \(L\) is guaranteed from the result that \(f([-k,k])\) has non-empty interior in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).) Therefore, \[f^{-1}|_L: L \to [-k,k]\]is injective and continuous. This is a contradiction, since there is no injective continuous function acting from a circle into the real line. Hence the theorem. Theorem : Let \(f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}\) be continuous with respect to each variables \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}\), then \(f\) is not an injection. Proof Let, if possible \(f\) is injective. Define, \(\phi(x)=f(x,0), \forall~ x\in\mathbb{R}\). Then \(\phi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) is continuous. Put \(\phi(0)=a, \phi(1)=b\). Since \(f\) is injective, we have \(a \neq b\). Without loss of generality, assume \(a&lt;b\). Since \(\phi\) is continuous on \([0,1]\), we have \([\phi(0),\phi(1)]=[a,b].\) In particular, \(\exists~x_0\in(0,1)\) such that \[\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}.\]Now, define \(\psi(y)=f(x_0,y), \forall~y\in\mathbb{R}.\) Then \(\psi\) is continuous and \[\psi(0)=f(x_0,0)=\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}\]Therefore, we have \(a&lt;\psi(0)&lt;b.\) Since, \(\psi\) is continuous, there exists a neighborhood \(N(0)\) of \(0\) such that \[a&lt;\psi(y)=f(x_0,y)&lt;b \quad \forall~y\in N(0).\]Hence we have \(\{f(x_0,y):y\in N&#39;(0)\}\subset (a,b) \subset \{f(x,0):0 \leq x &lt; 1\}\). Therefore, \(\exists~ y_0\neq 0\) and \(x_1 \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(f(x_0,y_0)=f(x_1,0)\). Which contradicts the injectivity of \(f\). So, our assumption that \(f\) is continuous is false. Hence the theorem. Conclusion Firstly, we conclude that the Cantor Function is a increasing function in \([0,1]\), and again \(f&#39;(x)=0\) at almost every point in its domain. Which is counter-intuitive. And we call such functions : Singular Function. From the second observation, it is reasonable to ask whether there exist continuous surjections from \(\mathbb{R}\) onto \(\mathbb{R}^2\) or from \([0,1]\) onto \([0,1]^2\). It turns out that such surjections do exist. The example of a continuous surjective function acting from \([0,1]\) onto \([0,1]^2\) was first constructed Peano. These kind of functions are known as Peano type function. In order to demonstrate the existence of Peano type functions, we again have to use the classical Cantor construction of his famous discontinuum, \(\Delta\). Let \(E\) be an arbitrary nonempty compact metric space. Then there exists a continuous surjection acting from \(\Delta\) onto \(E.\) References Real Analysis, N.L.

Hence we have the following result: Let \(f:\Delta \to [0,1]\) be the Cantor function (defined above) and let \(x,y \in \Delta\) with \(x&lt;y\). Then \(f(x) \leq f(y)\). Equality holds if and only if \(x\) and \(y\) are consecutive endpoints. Now, as the Cantor function is surjective, we have \(|\Delta| \geq |[0,1]|\), and by construction of Cantor set, \(|\Delta| \leq |[0,1]|\). Hence, from Schoeder-Bernstein theorem, \(|\Delta|=|[0,1]|\). So, \(\Delta\) is uncountable and has cardinality equal to that of continuum. With the above properties of the cantor function defined on \(\Delta\), we extend this function on the interval \([0,1]\) in the following section. Extended Cantor Function With the observation in Proposition 0.1, we take \(f\) to be an appropriate constant on each of the open intervals that make up \([0,1]\backslash \Delta\). For example, \(f(x)=f(1/3)=1/2\) for each \(x\) in the interval \((1/3,2/3)\), and \(f(x)=f(1/9)=1/4\) for each \(x \in (1/9,2/9)\). We define \[f(x)= \sup\{f(y):y\in \Delta, y \leq x\} \qquad \forall~ x \in [0,1]\backslash \Delta\] Now, since the Cantor function is increasing and the extended function is constant on every open interval, \(f\) is increasing on \([0,1]\). Also from the definition of Cantor function, we have \(f\) is a surjection, which is easy to verify. Now we prove the continuity of \(f\) in \([0,1]\). To prove the desired result we use the following theorem. If \(f:(a,b) \to \mathbb{R}\) is monotone, then \(f\) has atmost countably many points of discontinuity in \((a,b)\) and all of which are jump discontinuities. If \(f: [a,b] \to [c,d]\) is both monotone and onto, then \(f\) is continuous. Corollary :The Cantor function \(f:[0,1]\to [0,1]\) is continuous. Hence, we have the required result that, the function \(f\) is increasing and continuous. Again \(f&#39;=0\) at almost every point in \([0,1]\), i.e. \(f&#39;=0\) on \([0,1]\backslash \Delta\), a set of measure \(1\). So, \(f\) is also called singular function. We have therefore shown that \(f\) is continuous, monotonic, non-constant, and singular. We now investigate the differentiability of \(f\) at the points of \(\Delta\). At a left hand endpoint of a complementary interval, the right-hand derivative exists and is equal to \(0\). And similarly, a left-hand derivative at a right hand end point of is equal to \(0\). Now, let \(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n200\ldots\) (base \(3\)), be a right hand end point. Let, \(m&gt;n\) and \(h \in (3^{-m-1},3^{-m})\), hence, \[\frac{3^{m}}{2^{m+1}} \leq \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\]Now, \(h\to 0 \implies m \to \infty\), therefore, \[\lim\limits_{m \to \infty}\frac{3^m}{2^{m+1}} \leq \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \lim\limits_{m \to \infty} \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\] Hence, at a right hand end point and a left hand end point \(x\), we have right hand derivative \(f&#39;_+(x)=+\infty\) and left hand derivative \(f&#39;_-(x)=0\). Cantor Type Functions One of the major breakthroughs in the history of mathematics, i.e., one of the first set-theoretical result of Cantor was his discovery of the existence of a bijection between \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^2\). A previously known result was a bijection between \(\mathbb{N}\) and \(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\). The standard partition \((\{0, 2, 4, \ldots\}, \{1, 3, 5, \ldots\})\) of \(\mathbb{N}\) into two infinite sets shows the existence of a bijection between \(\mathbb{N}\) and \((\mathbb{N} \times \{0\}) \cup (\mathbb{N} \times \{1\})\). By starting with the latter bijection, it is not hard to establish a one-to-one correspondence between \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{R}^2\) (respectively, between the unit segment \([0, 1]\) and the unit square \([0,1]^2\)). Keeping these in mind we define the following. Definition :A map \(f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2\) (respectively from \([0,1]\) into \([0,1]^2\)) is a Cantor type function if \(f\) is a bijection. With the previous discussion, it is now clear that Cantor type function exists. Now we have the following theorems. Theorem : If \(f\) is a cantor type function, then it is not continuous. Proof If possible, let \(f\) is continuous. Then we wrte, \[\mathbb{R}^2 = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f([-n,n])\]where \(f([-n,n])\) is compact (closed) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), \(\forall~ n \in \mathbb{N}\). Now, from Baire Category Theorem, at least one of these sets have non-empty interior. Let \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) be such that \((f([-k,k]))^{\circ} \neq \phi.\) So, we have the bijective continuous mapping \[f|_{[-k,k]}:[-k,k]\to f([-k,k])\]which is a homeomorphism between \([-k,k]\) to \(f([-k,k])\). So, the function \(f^{-1}\) defined by \[f^{-1}|_{f([-k,k])}:f([-k,k])\to [-k,k]\]is also a homeomorphism. Now, let \(L \subset f([-k,k])\) such that \(L\) is isometric to \[\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2=r, r&gt;0\}\](The existence of \(L\) is guaranteed from the result that \(f([-k,k])\) has non-empty interior in \(\mathbb{R}^2\).) Therefore, \[f^{-1}|_L: L \to [-k,k]\]is injective and continuous. This is a contradiction, since there is no injective continuous function acting from a circle into the real line. Hence the theorem. Theorem : Let \(f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}\) be continuous with respect to each variables \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}\), then \(f\) is not an injection. Proof Let, if possible \(f\) is injective. Define, \(\phi(x)=f(x,0), \forall~ x\in\mathbb{R}\). Then \(\phi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) is continuous. Put \(\phi(0)=a, \phi(1)=b\). Since \(f\) is injective, we have \(a \neq b\). Without loss of generality, assume \(a&lt;b\). Since \(\phi\) is continuous on \([0,1]\), we have \([\phi(0),\phi(1)]=[a,b].\) In particular, \(\exists~x_0\in(0,1)\) such that \[\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}.\]Now, define \(\psi(y)=f(x_0,y), \forall~y\in\mathbb{R}.\) Then \(\psi\) is continuous and \[\psi(0)=f(x_0,0)=\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}\]Therefore, we have \(a&lt;\psi(0)&lt;b.\) Since, \(\psi\) is continuous, there exists a neighborhood \(N(0)\) of \(0\) such that \[a&lt;\psi(y)=f(x_0,y)&lt;b \quad \forall~y\in N(0).\]Hence we have \(\{f(x_0,y):y\in N&#39;(0)\}\subset (a,b) \subset \{f(x,0):0 \leq x &lt; 1\}\). Therefore, \(\exists~ y_0\neq 0\) and \(x_1 \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(f(x_0,y_0)=f(x_1,0)\). Which contradicts the injectivity of \(f\). So, our assumption that \(f\) is continuous is false. Hence the theorem. Conclusion Firstly, we conclude that the Cantor Function is a increasing function in \([0,1]\), and again \(f&#39;(x)=0\) at almost every point in its domain.

Now, if \\(x \\in \\Delta\\) has two ternary expansions, i.e., \\(x=0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n1= 0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n0222\\ldots\\), then \\[\\begin{aligned} f(x)&amp;=f(0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n1 (\\text{base } 3)) \\\\ &amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n0222\\ldots(\\text{base } 3)) \\\\ &amp;= 0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n0111\\ldots (\\text{base } 2) \\qquad(b_n = 0, 1) \\\\ &amp;= 0.b_1b_2\\ldots b_n1 (\\text{base } 2) \\\\ &amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n2 (\\text{base } 3)) \\end{aligned}\\] Now, if \\(x, y \\in \\Delta\\) are consecutive endpoints of the form \\(x=0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n1\\) and \\(y=0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n2\\) in base \\(3\\), then from the previous result, we have \\(f(x)=f(y)\\). Hence we have the following result: Let \\(f:\\Delta \\to [0,1]\\) be the Cantor function (defined above) and let \\(x,y \\in \\Delta\\) with \\(x&lt;y\\). Then \\(f(x) \\leq f(y)\\). Equality holds if and only if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are consecutive endpoints. Now, as the Cantor function is surjective, we have \\(|\\Delta| \\geq |[0,1]|\\), and by construction of Cantor set, \\(|\\Delta| \\leq |[0,1]|\\). Hence, from Schoeder-Bernstein theorem, \\(|\\Delta|=|[0,1]|\\). So, \\(\\Delta\\) is uncountable and has cardinality equal to that of continuum. With the above properties of the cantor function defined on \\(\\Delta\\), we extend this function on the interval \\([0,1]\\) in the following section. Extended Cantor Function With the observation in Proposition 0.1, we take \\(f\\) to be an appropriate constant on each of the open intervals that make up \\([0,1]\\backslash \\Delta\\). For example, \\(f(x)=f(1/3)=1/2\\) for each \\(x\\) in the interval \\((1/3,2/3)\\), and \\(f(x)=f(1/9)=1/4\\) for each \\(x \\in (1/9,2/9)\\). We define \\[f(x)= \\sup\\{f(y):y\\in \\Delta, y \\leq x\\} \\qquad \\forall~ x \\in [0,1]\\backslash \\Delta\\] Now, since the Cantor function is increasing and the extended function is constant on every open interval, \\(f\\) is increasing on \\([0,1]\\). Also from the definition of Cantor function, we have \\(f\\) is a surjection, which is easy to verify. Now we prove the continuity of \\(f\\) in \\([0,1]\\). To prove the desired result we use the following theorem. If \\(f:(a,b) \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) is monotone, then \\(f\\) has atmost countably many points of discontinuity in \\((a,b)\\) and all of which are jump discontinuities. If \\(f: [a,b] \\to [c,d]\\) is both monotone and onto, then \\(f\\) is continuous. Corollary :The Cantor function \\(f:[0,1]\\to [0,1]\\) is continuous. Hence, we have the required result that, the function \\(f\\) is increasing and continuous. Again \\(f&#39;=0\\) at almost every point in \\([0,1]\\), i.e. \\(f&#39;=0\\) on \\([0,1]\\backslash \\Delta\\), a set of measure \\(1\\). So, \\(f\\) is also called singular function. We have therefore shown that \\(f\\) is continuous, monotonic, non-constant, and singular. We now investigate the differentiability of \\(f\\) at the points of \\(\\Delta\\). At a left hand endpoint of a complementary interval, the right-hand derivative exists and is equal to \\(0\\). And similarly, a left-hand derivative at a right hand end point of is equal to \\(0\\). Now, let \\(x=0.a_1a_2\\ldots a_n200\\ldots\\) (base \\(3\\)), be a right hand end point. Let, \\(m&gt;n\\) and \\(h \\in (3^{-m-1},3^{-m})\\), hence, \\[\\frac{3^{m}}{2^{m+1}} \\leq \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \\leq \\frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\\]Now, \\(h\\to 0 \\implies m \\to \\infty\\), therefore, \\[\\lim\\limits_{m \\to \\infty}\\frac{3^m}{2^{m+1}} \\leq \\lim\\limits_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \\leq \\lim\\limits_{m \\to \\infty} \\frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\\] Hence, at a right hand end point and a left hand end point \\(x\\), we have right hand derivative \\(f&#39;_+(x)=+\\infty\\) and left hand derivative \\(f&#39;_-(x)=0\\). Cantor Type Functions One of the major breakthroughs in the history of mathematics, i.e., one of the first set-theoretical result of Cantor was his discovery of the existence of a bijection between \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). A previously known result was a bijection between \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}\\). The standard partition \\((\\{0, 2, 4, \\ldots\\}, \\{1, 3, 5, \\ldots\\})\\) of \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) into two infinite sets shows the existence of a bijection between \\(\\mathbb{N}\\) and \\((\\mathbb{N} \\times \\{0\\}) \\cup (\\mathbb{N} \\times \\{1\\})\\). By starting with the latter bijection, it is not hard to establish a one-to-one correspondence between \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) (respectively, between the unit segment \\([0, 1]\\) and the unit square \\([0,1]^2\\)). Keeping these in mind we define the following. Definition :A map \\(f:\\mathbb{R}\\to \\mathbb{R}^2\\) (respectively from \\([0,1]\\) into \\([0,1]^2\\)) is a Cantor type function if \\(f\\) is a bijection. With the previous discussion, it is now clear that Cantor type function exists. Now we have the following theorems. Theorem : If \\(f\\) is a cantor type function, then it is not continuous. Proof If possible, let \\(f\\) is continuous. Then we wrte, \\[\\mathbb{R}^2 = \\bigcup_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} f([-n,n])\\]where \\(f([-n,n])\\) is compact (closed) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\), \\(\\forall~ n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Now, from Baire Category Theorem, at least one of these sets have non-empty interior. Let \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\) be such that \\((f([-k,k]))^{\\circ} \\neq \\phi.\\) So, we have the bijective continuous mapping \\[f|_{[-k,k]}:[-k,k]\\to f([-k,k])\\]which is a homeomorphism between \\([-k,k]\\) to \\(f([-k,k])\\). So, the function \\(f^{-1}\\) defined by \\[f^{-1}|_{f([-k,k])}:f([-k,k])\\to [-k,k]\\]is also a homeomorphism. Now, let \\(L \\subset f([-k,k])\\) such that \\(L\\) is isometric to \\[\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2=r, r&gt;0\\}\\](The existence of \\(L\\) is guaranteed from the result that \\(f([-k,k])\\) has non-empty interior in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).) Therefore, \\[f^{-1}|_L: L \\to [-k,k]\\]is injective and continuous. This is a contradiction, since there is no injective continuous function acting from a circle into the real line. Hence the theorem. Theorem : Let \\(f:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to \\mathbb{R}\\) be continuous with respect to each variables \\(x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}\\), then \\(f\\) is not an injection. Proof Let, if possible \\(f\\) is injective. Define, \\(\\phi(x)=f(x,0), \\forall~ x\\in\\mathbb{R}\\). Then \\(\\phi:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) is continuous. Put \\(\\phi(0)=a, \\phi(1)=b\\). Since \\(f\\) is injective, we have \\(a \\neq b\\). Without loss of generality, assume \\(a&lt;b\\). Since \\(\\phi\\) is continuous on \\([0,1]\\), we have \\([\\phi(0),\\phi(1)]=[a,b].\\) In particular, \\(\\exists~x_0\\in(0,1)\\) such that \\[\\phi(x_0)=\\frac{a+b}{2}.\\]Now, define \\(\\psi(y)=f(x_0,y), \\forall~y\\in\\mathbb{R}.\\) Then \\(\\psi\\) is continuous and \\[\\psi(0)=f(x_0,0)=\\phi(x_0)=\\frac{a+b}{2}\\]Therefore, we have \\(a&lt;\\psi(0)&lt;b.\\) Since, \\(\\psi\\) is continuous, there exists a neighborhood \\(N(0)\\) of \\(0\\) such that \\[a&lt;\\psi(y)=f(x_0,y)&lt;b \\quad \\forall~y\\in N(0).\\]Hence we have \\(\\{f(x_0,y):y\\in N&#39;(0)\\}\\subset (a,b) \\subset \\{f(x,0):0 \\leq x &lt; 1\\}\\). Therefore, \\(\\exists~ y_0\\neq 0\\) and \\(x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}\\) such that \\(f(x_0,y_0)=f(x_1,0)\\). Which contradicts the injectivity of \\(f\\). So, our assumption that \\(f\\) is continuous is false. Hence the theorem. Conclusion Firstly, we conclude that the Cantor Function is a increasing function in \\([0,1]\\), and again \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\) at almost every point in its domain. Which is counter-intuitive. And we call such functions : Singular Function. From the second observation, it is reasonable to ask whether there exist continuous surjections from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) onto \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) or from \\([0,1]\\) onto \\([0,1]^2\\). It turns out that such surjections do exist. The example of a continuous surjective function acting from \\([0,1]\\) onto \\([0,1]^2\\) was first constructed Peano. These kind of functions are known as Peano type function. In order to demonstrate the existence of Peano type functions, we again have to use the classical Cantor construction of his famous discontinuum, \\(\\Delta\\). Let \\(E\\) be an arbitrary nonempty compact metric space. Then there exists a continuous surjection acting from \\(\\Delta\\) onto \\(E.\\) References Real Analysis, N.L.

<p><span><h1>Introduction</h1></span> Cantor set (or, Cantor <em>ternary</em> set) is an intriguing and unusual subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, which is constructed by successively removing "middle thirds" from the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. We denote the Cantor set by : <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. Set theory tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is uncountable. More precisely, The cardinality of Cantor’s set is the <em>continuum</em>. That is, Cantor’s set has the same cardinality as the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span> and that of the whole <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Measure theory tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is "small", i.e., it has measure <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Topology tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is a perfect set and is totally disconnected. And also, Geometry tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is a Fractal (self-similar).</p>
<p>From the construction of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, we also have <span class="math inline">\(x \in \Delta\)</span>, <em>if and only if</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{3^n}\)</span>, where each <span class="math inline">\(a_n \in \{0,2\}\)</span>. With all these properties in mind, we define a correspondence between <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> in the following section.</p>
<p><span><h1>The Cantor Function</h1></span></p>
<p>We define the Cantor function <span class="math inline">\(f: \Delta \to [0,1]\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[f\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2b_n}{3^n}\right)= \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{2^n} \qquad (b_n = 0, 1).\]</span>i.e. <span class="math display">\[f(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots (\text{base } 3))=0.\frac{a_1}{2}\frac{a_2}{2}\frac{a_3}{2}\cdots (\text{base 2}) \qquad (a_n = 0, 2).\]</span></p>
<p>From the definition of the Cantor function, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is increasing. i.e., if <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in \Delta\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\leq f(y)\)</span>. Now, if <span class="math inline">\(x \in \Delta\)</span> has two ternary expansions, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1= 0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n0222\ldots\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f(x)&amp;=f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1 (\text{base } 3)) \\
&amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n0222\ldots(\text{base } 3)) \\
&amp;= 0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n0111\ldots (\text{base } 2)  \qquad(b_n = 0, 1) \\
&amp;= 0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n1 (\text{base } 2) \\
&amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n2 (\text{base } 3)) 
\end{aligned}\]</span> Now, if <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \Delta\)</span> are <em>consecutive</em> endpoints of the form <span class="math inline">\(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n2\)</span> in base <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, then from the previous result, we have <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(y)\)</span>. Hence we have the following result:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f:\Delta \to [0,1]\)</span> be the Cantor function (defined above) and let <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in \Delta\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;y\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq f(y)\)</span>. Equality holds <em>if and only if</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are <em>consecutive</em> endpoints.</p>
<p>Now, as the Cantor function is surjective, we have <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta| \geq |[0,1]|\)</span>, and by construction of Cantor set, <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta| \leq |[0,1]|\)</span>. Hence, from <em>Schoeder-Bernstein theorem</em>, <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta|=|[0,1]|\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is uncountable and has cardinality equal to that of continuum.</p>
<p>With the above properties of the cantor function defined on <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, we extend this function on the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> in the following section.</p>
<p><span><h1>Extended Cantor Function</h1></span> With the observation in Proposition 0.1, we take <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be an appropriate constant on each of the open intervals that make up <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\backslash \Delta\)</span>. For example, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(1/3)=1/2\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the interval <span class="math inline">\((1/3,2/3)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(1/9)=1/4\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x \in (1/9,2/9)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We define <span class="math display">\[f(x)= \sup\{f(y):y\in \Delta, y \leq x\} \qquad \forall~ x \in [0,1]\backslash \Delta\]</span></p>
<p>Now, since the Cantor function is increasing and the extended function is constant on every open interval, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is increasing on <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. Also from the definition of Cantor function, we have <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a surjection, which is easy to verify. Now we prove the continuity of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. To prove the desired result we use the following theorem.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f:(a,b) \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> is monotone, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has <em>atmost countably many</em> points of discontinuity in <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> and all of which are jump discontinuities.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f: [a,b] \to [c,d]\)</span> is both monotone and onto, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous.</p>
<p><b>Corollary :</b>The Cantor function <span class="math inline">\(f:[0,1]\to [0,1]\)</span> is continuous.</p>
<p>Hence, we have the required result that, the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is increasing and continuous. Again <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;=0\)</span> at <em>almost every</em> point in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;=0\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\backslash \Delta\)</span>, a set of measure <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is also called <em>singular</em> function.</p>
<p>We have therefore shown that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous, monotonic, non-constant, and singular. We now investigate the differentiability of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at the points of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>At a left hand endpoint of a complementary interval, the right-hand derivative exists and is equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. And similarly, a left-hand derivative at a right hand end point of is equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, let <span class="math inline">\(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n200\ldots\)</span> (base <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>), be a right hand end point. Let, <span class="math inline">\(m&gt;n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h \in (3^{-m-1},3^{-m})\)</span>, hence, <span class="math display">\[\frac{3^{m}}{2^{m+1}} \leq \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\]</span>Now, <span class="math inline">\(h\to 0 \implies m \to \infty\)</span>, therefore, <span class="math display">\[\lim\limits_{m \to \infty}\frac{3^m}{2^{m+1}} \leq \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \lim\limits_{m \to \infty} \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\]</span> Hence, at a right hand end point and a left hand end point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we have right hand derivative <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;_+(x)=+\infty\)</span> and left hand derivative <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;_-(x)=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><h1>Cantor Type Functions</h1></span> One of the major breakthroughs in the history of mathematics, i.e., one of the first set-theoretical result of Cantor was his discovery of the existence of a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>.

<p>With the previous discussion, it is now clear that Cantor type function exists. Now we have the following theorems.</p>
<p><b>Theorem :</b> If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a cantor type function, then it is not continuous.</p>
<h4>Proof</h4>
<p>If possible, let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous. Then we wrte, <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{R}^2 = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f([-n,n])\]</span>where <span class="math inline">\(f([-n,n])\)</span> is compact (closed) in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\forall~ n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. Now, from Baire Category Theorem, at least one of these sets have non-empty interior. Let <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> be such that <span class="math inline">\((f([-k,k]))^{\circ} \neq \phi.\)</span> So, we have the bijective continuous mapping <span class="math display">\[f|_{[-k,k]}:[-k,k]\to f([-k,k])\]</span>which is a homeomorphism between <span class="math inline">\([-k,k]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f([-k,k])\)</span>. So, the function <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> defined by <span class="math display">\[f^{-1}|_{f([-k,k])}:f([-k,k])\to [-k,k]\]</span>is also a homeomorphism. Now, let <span class="math inline">\(L \subset f([-k,k])\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is isometric to <span class="math display">\[\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2=r, r&gt;0\}\]</span>(The existence of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is guaranteed from the result that <span class="math inline">\(f([-k,k])\)</span> has non-empty interior in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>.) Therefore, <span class="math display">\[f^{-1}|_L: L \to [-k,k]\]</span>is injective and continuous. This is a contradiction, since there is no injective continuous function acting from a circle into the real line. Hence the theorem.</p>
<p><b>Theorem :</b> Let <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}\)</span> be continuous with respect to each variables <span class="math inline">\(x,y\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not an injection.</p>
<h4>Proof</h4>
<p>Let, if possible <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective. Define, <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)=f(x,0), \forall~ x\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\phi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\)</span> is continuous. Put <span class="math inline">\(\phi(0)=a, \phi(1)=b\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective, we have <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span>. Without loss of generality, assume <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is continuous on <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\([\phi(0),\phi(1)]=[a,b].\)</span> In particular, <span class="math inline">\(\exists~x_0\in(0,1)\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}.\]</span>Now, define <span class="math inline">\(\psi(y)=f(x_0,y), \forall~y\in\mathbb{R}.\)</span> Then <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is continuous and <span class="math display">\[\psi(0)=f(x_0,0)=\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}\]</span>Therefore, we have <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;\psi(0)&lt;b.\)</span> Since, <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is continuous, there exists a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(N(0)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[a&lt;\psi(y)=f(x_0,y)&lt;b \quad \forall~y\in N(0).\]</span>Hence we have <span class="math inline">\(\{f(x_0,y):y\in N&#39;(0)\}\subset (a,b) \subset \{f(x,0):0 \leq x &lt; 1\}\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\exists~ y_0\neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1 \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0,y_0)=f(x_1,0)\)</span>. Which contradicts the injectivity of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, our assumption that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous is false. Hence the theorem.</p>
<p><span><h1>Conclusion</h1></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, we conclude that the <em>Cantor Function</em> is a increasing function in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, and again <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;(x)=0\)</span> at almost every point in its domain. Which is counter-intuitive. And we call such functions : <em>Singular Function</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>From the second observation, it is reasonable to ask whether there exist continuous surjections from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> or from <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\([0,1]^2\)</span>. It turns out that such surjections do exist. The example of a continuous surjective function acting from <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\([0,1]^2\)</span> was first constructed Peano. These kind of functions are known as <em>Peano type function</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to demonstrate the existence of Peano type functions, we again have to use the classical Cantor construction of his famous discontinuum, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be an arbitrary nonempty compact metric space. Then there exists a continuous surjection acting from <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(E.\)</span></p></li>
