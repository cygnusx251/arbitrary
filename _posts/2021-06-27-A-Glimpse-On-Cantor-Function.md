<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cantor set (or, Cantor ternary set) is an intriguing and unusual subset of $\mathbb{R}$, which is constructed by successively removing "middle thirds" from the interval $[0,1]$. We denote the Cantor set by : $\Delta$. Set theory tells us that $\Delta$ is uncountable. More precisely, The cardinality of Cantor’s set is the continuum. That is, Cantor’s set has the same cardinality as the interval $[0, 1]$ and that of the whole $\mathbb{R}$. Measure theory tells us that $\Delta$ is "small", i.e., it has measure $0$. Topology tells us that $\Delta$ is a perfect set and is totally disconnected. And also, Geometry tells us that $\Delta$ is a Fractal (self-similar). </p>

<p>From the construction of $\Delta$, we also have $x \in \Delta$, if and only if $x$ can be written as $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{3^n}$, where each $a_n \in \{0,2\}$. With all these properties in mind, we define a correspondence between $\Delta$ and $[0,1]$ in the following section.</p>

<h2>The Cantor Function</h2>
<p><b>Definition :</b> <i>We define the Cantor function $f: \Delta \to [0,1]$ by \(f\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2b_n}{3^n}\right)= \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{2^n} \qquad (b_n = 0, 1).\) i.e. \(f(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots (\text{base } 3))=0.\frac{a_1}{2}\frac{a_2}{2}\frac{a_3}{2}\cdots (\text{base 2}) \qquad (a_n = 0, 2).\)</i></p>
