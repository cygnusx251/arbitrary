<p><span><h1>Introduction</h1></span> Cantor set (or, Cantor <em>ternary</em> set) is an intriguing and unusual subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, which is constructed by successively removing "middle thirds" from the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. We denote the Cantor set by : <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>. Set theory tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is uncountable. More precisely, The cardinality of Cantor’s set is the <em>continuum</em>. That is, Cantor’s set has the same cardinality as the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span> and that of the whole <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Measure theory tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is "small", i.e., it has measure <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Topology tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is a perfect set and is totally disconnected. And also, Geometry tells us that <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is a Fractal (self-similar).</p>
<p>From the construction of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, we also have <span class="math inline">\(x \in \Delta\)</span>, <em>if and only if</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can be written as <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{a_n}{3^n}\)</span>, where each <span class="math inline">\(a_n \in \{0,2\}\)</span>. With all these properties in mind, we define a correspondence between <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> in the following section.</p>
<p><span><h1>The Cantor Function</h1></span></p>
<p>We define the Cantor function <span class="math inline">\(f: \Delta \to [0,1]\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[f\left(\sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2b_n}{3^n}\right)= \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_n}{2^n} \qquad (b_n = 0, 1).\]</span>i.e. <span class="math display">\[f(0.a_1a_2a_3\ldots (\text{base } 3))=0.\frac{a_1}{2}\frac{a_2}{2}\frac{a_3}{2}\cdots (\text{base 2}) \qquad (a_n = 0, 2).\]</span></p>
<p>From the definition of the Cantor function, we can see that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is increasing. i.e., if <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in \Delta\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;y\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\leq f(y)\)</span>. Now, if <span class="math inline">\(x \in \Delta\)</span> has two ternary expansions, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1= 0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n0222\ldots\)</span>, then <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f(x)&amp;=f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1 (\text{base } 3)) \\
&amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n0222\ldots(\text{base } 3)) \\
&amp;= 0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n0111\ldots (\text{base } 2)  \qquad(b_n = 0, 1) \\
&amp;= 0.b_1b_2\ldots b_n1 (\text{base } 2) \\
&amp;= f(0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n2 (\text{base } 3)) 
\end{aligned}\]</span> Now, if <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \Delta\)</span> are <em>consecutive</em> endpoints of the form <span class="math inline">\(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n2\)</span> in base <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, then from the previous result, we have <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(y)\)</span>. Hence we have the following result:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f:\Delta \to [0,1]\)</span> be the Cantor function (defined above) and let <span class="math inline">\(x,y \in \Delta\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x&lt;y\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(f(x) \leq f(y)\)</span>. Equality holds <em>if and only if</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are <em>consecutive</em> endpoints.</p>
<p>Now, as the Cantor function is surjective, we have <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta| \geq |[0,1]|\)</span>, and by construction of Cantor set, <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta| \leq |[0,1]|\)</span>. Hence, from <em>Schoeder-Bernstein theorem</em>, <span class="math inline">\(|\Delta|=|[0,1]|\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is uncountable and has cardinality equal to that of continuum.</p>
<p>With the above properties of the cantor function defined on <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>, we extend this function on the interval <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> in the following section.</p>
<p><span><h1>Extended Cantor Function</h1></span> With the observation in Proposition 0.1, we take <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to be an appropriate constant on each of the open intervals that make up <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\backslash \Delta\)</span>. For example, <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(1/3)=1/2\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in the interval <span class="math inline">\((1/3,2/3)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=f(1/9)=1/4\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(x \in (1/9,2/9)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We define <span class="math display">\[f(x)= \sup\{f(y):y\in \Delta, y \leq x\} \qquad \forall~ x \in [0,1]\backslash \Delta\]</span></p>
<p>Now, since the Cantor function is increasing and the extended function is constant on every open interval, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is increasing on <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. Also from the definition of Cantor function, we have <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a surjection, which is easy to verify. Now we prove the continuity of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>. To prove the desired result we use the following theorem.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f:(a,b) \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> is monotone, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has <em>atmost countably many</em> points of discontinuity in <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> and all of which are jump discontinuities.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(f: [a,b] \to [c,d]\)</span> is both monotone and onto, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous.</p>
<p><b>Corollary :</b>The Cantor function <span class="math inline">\(f:[0,1]\to [0,1]\)</span> is continuous.</p>
<p>Hence, we have the required result that, the function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is increasing and continuous. Again <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;=0\)</span> at <em>almost every</em> point in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;=0\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\backslash \Delta\)</span>, a set of measure <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. So, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is also called <em>singular</em> function.</p>
<p>We have therefore shown that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous, monotonic, non-constant, and singular. We now investigate the differentiability of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> at the points of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p>
<p>At a left hand endpoint of a complementary interval, the right-hand derivative exists and is equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. And similarly, a left-hand derivative at a right hand end point of is equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, let <span class="math inline">\(x=0.a_1a_2\ldots a_n200\ldots\)</span> (base <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>), be a right hand end point. Let, <span class="math inline">\(m&gt;n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h \in (3^{-m-1},3^{-m})\)</span>, hence, <span class="math display">\[\frac{3^{m}}{2^{m+1}} \leq \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\]</span>Now, <span class="math inline">\(h\to 0 \implies m \to \infty\)</span>, therefore, <span class="math display">\[\lim\limits_{m \to \infty}\frac{3^m}{2^{m+1}} \leq \lim\limits_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \leq \lim\limits_{m \to \infty} \frac{3^{m+1}}{2^m}\]</span> Hence, at a right hand end point and a left hand end point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, we have right hand derivative <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;_+(x)=+\infty\)</span> and left hand derivative <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;_-(x)=0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span><h1>Cantor Type Functions</h1></span> One of the major breakthroughs in the history of mathematics, i.e., one of the first set-theoretical result of Cantor was his discovery of the existence of a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>. A previously known result was a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The standard partition <span class="math inline">\((\{0, 2, 4, \ldots\}, \{1, 3, 5, \ldots\})\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> into two infinite sets shows the existence of a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{N} \times \{0\}) \cup (\mathbb{N} \times \{1\})\)</span>. By starting with the latter bijection, it is not hard to establish a one-to-one correspondence between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> (respectively, between the unit segment <span class="math inline">\([0, 1]\)</span> and the unit square <span class="math inline">\([0,1]^2\)</span>).</p>
<p>Keeping these in mind we define the following.</p>
<p><b>Definition :</b>A map <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}^2\)</span> (respectively from <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\([0,1]^2\)</span>) is a Cantor type function if <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bijection.</p>
<p>With the previous discussion, it is now clear that Cantor type function exists. Now we have the following theorems.</p>
<p><b>Theorem :</b> If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a cantor type function, then it is not continuous.</p>
<h4>Proof</h4>
<p>If possible, let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous. Then we wrte, <span class="math display">\[\mathbb{R}^2 = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} f([-n,n])\]</span>where <span class="math inline">\(f([-n,n])\)</span> is compact (closed) in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\forall~ n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. Now, from Baire Category Theorem, at least one of these sets have non-empty interior. Let <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> be such that <span class="math inline">\((f([-k,k]))^{\circ} \neq \phi.\)</span> So, we have the bijective continuous mapping <span class="math display">\[f|_{[-k,k]}:[-k,k]\to f([-k,k])\]</span>which is a homeomorphism between <span class="math inline">\([-k,k]\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f([-k,k])\)</span>. So, the function <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> defined by <span class="math display">\[f^{-1}|_{f([-k,k])}:f([-k,k])\to [-k,k]\]</span>is also a homeomorphism. Now, let <span class="math inline">\(L \subset f([-k,k])\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is isometric to <span class="math display">\[\{(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2:x^2+y^2=r, r&gt;0\}\]</span>(The existence of <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is guaranteed from the result that <span class="math inline">\(f([-k,k])\)</span> has non-empty interior in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span>.) Therefore, <span class="math display">\[f^{-1}|_L: L \to [-k,k]\]</span>is injective and continuous. This is a contradiction, since there is no injective continuous function acting from a circle into the real line. Hence the theorem.</p>
<p><b>Theorem :</b> Let <span class="math inline">\(f:\mathbb{R}^2\to \mathbb{R}\)</span> be continuous with respect to each variables <span class="math inline">\(x,y\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not an injection.</p>
<h4>Proof</h4>
<p>Let, if possible <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective. Define, <span class="math inline">\(\phi(x)=f(x,0), \forall~ x\in\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\phi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\)</span> is continuous. Put <span class="math inline">\(\phi(0)=a, \phi(1)=b\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is injective, we have <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span>. Without loss of generality, assume <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;b\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is continuous on <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\([\phi(0),\phi(1)]=[a,b].\)</span> In particular, <span class="math inline">\(\exists~x_0\in(0,1)\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}.\]</span>Now, define <span class="math inline">\(\psi(y)=f(x_0,y), \forall~y\in\mathbb{R}.\)</span> Then <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is continuous and <span class="math display">\[\psi(0)=f(x_0,0)=\phi(x_0)=\frac{a+b}{2}\]</span>Therefore, we have <span class="math inline">\(a&lt;\psi(0)&lt;b.\)</span> Since, <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is continuous, there exists a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(N(0)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> such that <span class="math display">\[a&lt;\psi(y)=f(x_0,y)&lt;b \quad \forall~y\in N(0).\]</span>Hence we have <span class="math inline">\(\{f(x_0,y):y\in N&#39;(0)\}\subset (a,b) \subset \{f(x,0):0 \leq x &lt; 1\}\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\exists~ y_0\neq 0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_1 \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f(x_0,y_0)=f(x_1,0)\)</span>. Which contradicts the injectivity of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, our assumption that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is continuous is false. Hence the theorem.</p>
<p><span><h1>Conclusion</h1></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Firstly, we conclude that the <em>Cantor Function</em> is a increasing function in <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>, and again <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;(x)=0\)</span> at almost every point in its domain. Which is counter-intuitive. And we call such functions : <em>Singular Function</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>From the second observation, it is reasonable to ask whether there exist continuous surjections from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^2\)</span> or from <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\([0,1]^2\)</span>. It turns out that such surjections do exist. The example of a continuous surjective function acting from <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\([0,1]^2\)</span> was first constructed Peano. These kind of functions are known as <em>Peano type function</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to demonstrate the existence of Peano type functions, we again have to use the classical Cantor construction of his famous discontinuum, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be an arbitrary nonempty compact metric space. Then there exists a continuous surjection acting from <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(E.\)</span></p></li>
